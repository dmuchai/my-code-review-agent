# Code Review: AI-Powered Code Review Agent Enhancement

## Summary

This pull request introduces a major upgrade to the project, transforming it into a full-fledged AI-powered code review agent. The changes are extensive, covering core functionality, documentation, and tooling. The agent now integrates custom tools for file analysis, commit message generation, review documentation, and git history retrieval. The `README.md` has been significantly expanded to provide comprehensive user guidance, and the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` has been meticulously crafted to instruct the AI on its review workflow and expected output format. This is a highly positive and impactful set of changes that greatly enhances the project's utility and usability.

## File-by-File Analysis

### `README.md`

*   **Positive Highlights**:
    *   **Comprehensive Documentation**: The `README.md` has been transformed into an excellent resource, covering features, installation, usage, tools, configuration, and examples. This greatly improves project understanding and onboarding.
    *   **Clear Feature Set**: The "Features" section effectively outlines the agent's capabilities and the specific areas it focuses on during a review.
    *   **Detailed Usage Examples**: The various usage examples (basic, full, commit message, specialized, custom) are very helpful for demonstrating how to interact with the agent.
    *   **Tool Descriptions**: Each available tool is clearly explained with code snippets, which is vital for understanding their purpose and how the agent utilizes them.
    *   **Output Examples**: Providing examples of generated commit messages and review markdown structures is a fantastic touch, setting clear expectations for users.
    *   **Project Structure & Dependencies**: These sections provide a good overview of the codebase and its requirements.

*   **Suggestions**:
    *   **Usage Section Alignment**: The "Usage" examples show imports from `./examples.ts`, but the `package.json` scripts primarily use `cli.ts`. It would be beneficial to align these, perhaps by explicitly stating that `examples.ts` showcases the underlying functions that `cli.ts` uses, or by having `cli.ts` examples in the `README`.
    *   **Repository URL**: Consider replacing `<repository-url>` in the installation instructions with the actual repository URL.

### `index.ts`

*   **Positive Highlights**:
    *   **Transition to `streamText`**: Moving from `generateText` to `streamText` is a significant improvement for user experience, enabling real-time output during the review process.
    *   **Robust Tool Integration**: All custom tools are correctly integrated into the `streamText` call, providing the AI with the necessary capabilities to perform comprehensive reviews.
    *   **`SYSTEM_PROMPT` Integration**: The use of `SYSTEM_PROMPT` ensures the agent operates with consistent instructions and adheres to the defined review methodology.
    *   **`stopWhen` Mechanism**: The `stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)` is a good safety measure to prevent excessive API usage, though its value may need tuning.

*   **Suggestions**:
    *   **Error Handling**: Consider adding `try-catch` blocks around the `streamText` call and within the streaming loop to handle potential API errors, network issues, or tool execution failures gracefully.
    *   **Modularity and CLI Entry Point**: Currently, `index.ts` acts as a default execution of the agent with a hardcoded prompt and directory. Given the `cli.ts` scripts in `package.json`, it would be more modular to:
        1.  Extract the `codeReviewAgent` function definition into a separate module (e.g., `src/agent/core.ts`).
        2.  Make `index.ts` a simple entry point that imports and runs a default review, or, ideally, have `cli.ts` be the main entry point that parses arguments and calls the `codeReviewAgent` function with dynamic parameters. This separation of concerns would greatly improve the project's architecture and flexibility.
    *   **Hardcoded Directory**: The prompt hardcodes `'../my-code-review-agent'`. This directory should be a parameter passed to the `codeReviewAgent` function, allowing it to review any specified directory. This is critical for a general-purpose tool.

### `package.json`

*   **Positive Highlights**:
    *   **Comprehensive Scripts**: The addition of various `scripts` (e.g., `review`, `review:basic`, `commit-msg`, `clean`) is excellent. It provides clear, easy-to-use entry points for different review types and development tasks.
    *   **`dev` script**: The `bun --watch index.ts` script is very useful for rapid development.
    *   **`clean` script**: A dedicated script to remove generated review files is a good practice for project hygiene.
    *   **New Dependencies**: The inclusion of `simple-git` and `zod` correctly addresses the new functional requirements for git operations and schema validation within the tools.

*   **Suggestions**:
    *   **Script Consistency (`cli.ts` vs `index.ts`)**: Re-evaluate the usage of `cli.ts` versus `index.ts` in the scripts. If `cli.ts` is intended to be the primary interface for users, then all `review:*` and `commit-msg` scripts should consistently point to `cli.ts`. This makes the project's entry points clearer. For example, `review` could also point to `cli.ts` with a default argument.
    *   **Script Naming Consistency**: Consider renaming `commit-msg` to `review:commit` for better consistency with the other `review:` prefixed scripts.

### `prompts.ts`

*   **Positive Highlights**:
    *   **Detailed Tool Instructions**: The `SYSTEM_PROMPT` now includes clear and concise descriptions of each available tool, guiding the AI on their purpose and usage.
    *   **Defined Review Workflow**: The "Enhanced Review Workflow" provides a structured, step-by-step process for the AI to follow, ensuring a consistent and comprehensive review approach.
    *   **Standardized Output Format**: The "Output Format for Reviews" section is crucial for generating structured and readable markdown reviews, which is a significant improvement for documentation.
    *   **Emphasis on Tool Usage**: The explicit instruction "Always use the available tools to provide comprehensive reviews and documentation" reinforces the intended behavior of the agent.

*   **Suggestions**:
    *   **Tool Description Detail**: For `getFileChangesInDirectoryTool`, consider adding a subtle hint that it returns not just changes but also their *diffs*, as this is often key for subsequent steps like commit message generation. This is a minor refinement.

## Suggestions

1.  **Modularize `codeReviewAgent`**: Extract the core `codeReviewAgent` logic from `index.ts` into its own module (e.g., `src/agent/core.ts`).
2.  **Implement `cli.ts` as Primary Entry**: Make `cli.ts` the primary entry point for user interaction, handling argument parsing (e.g., directory path, review type) and invoking the `codeReviewAgent` with appropriate parameters. This will allow the agent to review any directory, not just its own.
3.  **Enhance Error Handling**: Add robust `try-catch` blocks in `index.ts` (or the new `agent.ts` module) to gracefully manage errors during API calls or tool execution.
4.  **Tune `stopWhen` Value**: Experiment with the `stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)` value in `index.ts` (or the agent module) to ensure it's not too restrictive for complex reviews. Consider making it configurable.
5.  **`package.json` Script Consistency**: Align `package.json` scripts so that `cli.ts` is consistently used as the entry point for all review-related commands, and consider renaming `commit-msg` to `review:commit`.

## Positive Highlights

*   **Major Functional Enhancement**: The project has evolved from a basic example to a sophisticated, tool-integrated code review agent.
*   **Excellent Documentation**: The `README.md` is exceptionally well-written and comprehensive, making the project highly accessible.
*   **Clear AI Instructions**: The `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is meticulously designed, providing the AI with a robust framework for performing reviews.
*   **User-Friendly CLI**: The new `package.json` scripts indicate a strong move towards a more user-friendly command-line interface.

feat(agent): implement AI-powered code review agent with tools and enhanced documentation

This commit introduces a comprehensive AI-powered code review agent with the following key features:

- **Tool Integration**: Implemented and integrated custom tools for file change analysis, conventional commit message generation, markdown review documentation, and git history retrieval.
- **Enhanced Review Workflow**: Updated the SYSTEM_PROMPT to guide the AI through a structured review process, including file-by-file analysis, commit message generation, and documentation.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Significantly expanded the README.md to detail features, installation, usage examples, available tools, configuration options, and output formats.
- **CLI and Scripts**: Added new npm scripts in package.json to facilitate various review types and development workflows, and incorporated new dependencies (simple-git, zod).
- **Streaming Output**: Transitioned to streamText in index.ts for real-time output during code reviews.
```

## Action Items

1.  **Refactor `index.ts` and `cli.ts`**: Prioritize separating agent logic from execution and centralizing CLI argument parsing in `cli.ts` to support dynamic directory reviews. (High Priority)
2.  **Add Error Handling**: Implement `try-catch` blocks in the agent's core logic for robust error management. (High Priority)
3.  **Review `stopWhen` value**: Evaluate and potentially adjust the `stopWhen` parameter for `streamText` to ensure it accommodates complex reviews without prematurely stopping. (Medium Priority)
4.  **Align `package.json` scripts**: Standardize script names and entry points to consistently use `cli.ts` for user-facing commands. (Medium Priority)
